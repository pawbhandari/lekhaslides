# Fonts Directory

## Required Font

This directory should contain the **Caveat-Bold.ttf** font file for the slide generator.

### Download Instructions

1. Visit [Google Fonts - Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat)
2. Download the Caveat font family
3. Extract the zip file
4. Copy `Caveat-Bold.ttf` to this directory

Alternatively, you can download directly from the GitHub repository:
```bash
curl -L -o Caveat-Bold.ttf "https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/caveat/Caveat-Bold.ttf"
```

### Fallback

If the font file is not present, the application will fall back to the default system font, but the slides will not look as intended.
